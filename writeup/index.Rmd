```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```
```{r packages_libraries, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}

fricdat <- read_csv("../data_raw/fricatives.csv")

```

##Intro  
This writeup examines the `fricatives` dataset, which contains acoustic measures for the segments [s] and [sh]. Basic descriptive statsitics and exploratory data analysis are presented. Additionally, a linear model is fit to the data to explore the relationship between center of gravity and vowel skewness in [s] phonemes. The results of the model fit are also discussed.

##Data
This dataset contains center of gravity and skewness measurements for both [s] and [sh] phonemes across 20 experimental observations.
```{r, data_int, echo=F}
head(tidy_fric)
```

##Descriptive Statistics
Mean and standard deviations for center of gravity and skewness for each phoneme are presented in the following table:


| phoneme| COG        | skewness      |
| ---    | ---        | ---           |
| [s]    | 5690 (913) | 0.771 (0.283) |
| [sh]   | 3994 (697) | 0.553 (0.441) |



On average, center of gravity for [s] is higher than that of [sh] (see the boxplot below).


```{r, plot1, echo=F, fig.retina=2, fig.align="center"}
tidy_fric %>%
  ggplot(aes(phoneme, cog))+
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(title = "Center of Gravity as a Function of Phoneme",
         y = "Center of Gravity (Hz)",
         x = "Phoneme")       
```


The same can be said of skewness; [s] phonemes exhibit a higher degree of skewness than [sh]. The statistical summary below plots the mean skewness for each phoneme, as well as confidence limits without assuming normality (see `Hmisc::smean.cl.boot` documentation for more information)

```{r, plot2, echo=F, fig.retina=2, fig.align="center"}
tidy_fric %>%
  ggplot(aes(phoneme, skewness))+
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_boot)+
  labs(title = "Statistical Summary of Skewness, [s] and [sh]",
       y = "Skewness",
       x = "Phoneme")
```

##Linear Model
This writeup aims to examine the relationship between skewness and center of gravity for [s] phonemes. A linear model was fit to the data, setting center of gravity as the dependent variable, and skewness as an independent variable. Summary of the results are presented below.
```{r, table, echo=F}
x1 <- 8027
x2 <- 212
x3 <- x1 - (2*x2)
x4 <- x1 + (2*x2)
x5 <- 3029
x6 <- 259
x7 <- x5 - (2*x6)
x8 <- x5 + (2*x6)
```


|            | beta   | SE    | 95%LB | 95%UB | t-value | p.value |
| ---        | ---    | ---   | ---   | ---   | ---     | ---     |
| (Intercept)| `r x1` | `r x2`| `r x3`| `r x4`| 37.80   | <0.001  | 
| skewness   | `r x5` | `r x6`| `r x7`| `r x8`| 11.69   | <0.001  | 

The intercept for skewness indicates a positive correlation with gravity. This general tendency is illustrated in the graph below.
```{r, plot3, echo=F, fig.retina=2, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(tidy_s, aes(skewness, cog))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)+
  labs(x = "Skewness", y = "Center of Gravity",
       title = "Center of Gravity as a Function of Skewness, [s] Phonemes")
```

The next section discusses the results of the model and evaluates model diagnostics.

##Discussion
According to the model introduced above, there is a positive correlation between skewness and center of gravity on [s] segments, such that a single unit increase in skewness results in a 3000 Hz increase in center of gravity on average. As center of gravity on an [s] segment increases, so does its skewness; additionally, this effect was found to be significant (p<0.001).  
Analysis of model diagnostics is potentially problematic for this generalization. The mean of the residuals was 0, however the distribution of the 1st and 3rd quartiles suggests unequal variance.  
```{r, residuals, echo=F}
scsmod <- lm(cog ~ skewness, data = tidy_s)
summary(scsmod$residuals)
```

Heteroskedasticity and non-normality in residuals was found. This finding is in part due to several influential data points, specifically observations 1, 10, and 20. These are shown in the plots below:

```{r, residual_plots, fig.align="center", fig.retina=2, echo=F}
autoplot(scsmod, which = c(1,3,2))
```

There did not appear, however, to be any autocorrelation of residuals. 
```{r, residual_plots2, fig.align="center", fig.retina=2, echo=F}
acf(scsmod$residuals)
```

The sample size for the data was small (n=20), therefore more data should be collected to determine whether the influential data points in the current sample are indicative of an actual trend or simple random error.
